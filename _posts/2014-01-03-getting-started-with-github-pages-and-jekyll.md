### What is jekyll and why use it ?

> [simple, blog-aware, static sites](http://jekyllrb.com)


### Jekyll is awesome


* Generate static pages: no db, no server code, just you and your content
* Fast ! As fast as your hosting can be
* Integrates with Github pages so give you free hosting option with the tools you already know and love
* Easy to change templating 
* Clean and easy templating: great to improve your skills in web front end if you are like me more experienced on the server side coding


### First integration to github

Being quite newbie to the process I did not realize at first that there is 2 ways to do it.

1. You can use the default repo {name}.github.io (that you need to create at first). More [here](https://pages.github.com/). This will use the **master branch**

2. You can create any repository but the content of the site will have to be pushed to a **branch called gh-pages** (for GitHub Pages)

And this post clearly recap the choice you have and differences: [A guide to using github pages](http://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/start/new-project/)

### Choosing a theme

There is plenty of them available on the web. I chose [Minimal Mistake](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) because I like the simplicity of the design.

### Other useful links

I found [this post](http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/) describing a from scratch install really useful. If you want show tags check out Charlie Park [blog post](http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/) on the subject.
